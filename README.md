<H1>About me:</H1>

Hello! I am Majed Alrawashdeh, my Github user is: @MBY04.

<p>👀 About me: I am a 19 year old Computer Science student from the University of South Wales, and I grew up in the Middle East. I have developed a passion for computers and technology throughout my childhood. My fascination towards computers and technology came from my experience of owing the Sega Gensis and Sony Playstation consoles. These experiences have further developed my passion and interests and motivate me to become a future software engineer, aspiring to excel in my field.</p>

<p>🌱 What I am doing: I am currently a first year student in the University of South Wales, majoring in BSc Computer science, and I am about to finish my first semester. Throughout the semester, I have been studying about ciphers, C++, group and indivdual projects, and SQL programming. In my free time, I like to plan my acitivies throughout the day to maximize my productivity. During the day I sometimes enjoy calling friends and family to give updates and share quality time with each other, and spending time out with friends. I also make time to focus on myself by taking naps, snacks, and watching series. I am satisfied with how I manage my days, and I actively find new hobbies to continue occupying myself.</p>

<p>💞️ Skillset: I have proficiency with C++, Python, HTML&CSS, and basic SQL. I have created various small projects using C++ and Python languages, which have allowed me to develop my skills and expand my knowledge.</p>

<p>🌱 Hobbies: In my spare time I enjoy talking with friends and hanging out.</p>
